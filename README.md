**Introduction**  
Amidst the surge in e-commerce and the recent proliferation of OTT platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant uptick in credit card usage, along with various other payment methods. However, just as many natural phenomena exhibit binary characteristics, instances of credit card fraud have also skyrocketed. The global economy bears a hefty burden of over $24 billion annually due to these fraudulent activities. Consequently, addressing this issue has become imperative, leading to the emergence of numerous startups in this $30 billion industry. Therefore, the development of automated models to tackle this escalating problem is crucial, with AI and ML standing as pivotal solutions.


**Problem Statement**  

How to develop an automated classification model to classify whether a credit card transaction is fradulent or genuine and handle unbalanced dataset in the meantime.


**Dataset**  
the dataset contains 284807 records

•	V1 - V28 : Numerical features that are a result of PCA transformation.

•	Time : Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the 1st transaction.

•	Amount : Transaction amount.

•	Class : Fraud or otherwise (1 for fraud and 0 for genuine transaction)
